Implement a matched filter (normalized crosscorrelation) to recognize letters in an image of text.

The ground truth file lists all the letters and image pixel coordinates of text in the image.
The pixel coordinates are for the center point of each letter.

Write a brief report that includes the code and the ROC curve. Show your MSF
image. Identify the optimal T and FP and TP values at that threshold.
