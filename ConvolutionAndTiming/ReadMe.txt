In this project each student must implement three versions of a 7x7 mean filter. The first
version should use basic 2D convolution. The second version should use separable filters
(1x7 and 7x1). The third version should use separable filters and a sliding window.

Each version of the filter should be timed, and the typical amount of time reported (for
example, the average amount of time over ten runs).
